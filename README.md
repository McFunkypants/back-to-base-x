# Back To Base X

A micro-sized game written for the [js13kgames.com](http://js13kgames.com) "code-golfing" competition.

The theme for the 2019 cometition is "BACK" and the challenge is to develop an entire videogame (including art and sound!) which fits in a 13kb zip file. As someone used to making games that weigh in at 100MB or more, this is such a fun limitation!

The competition is from Aug. 13 to Sept. 13, 2019, and I am a judge. Therefore, I voluntarily disqualify myself, and am participating solely for the joy of gamedev.
